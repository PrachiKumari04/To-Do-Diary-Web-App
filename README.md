## To-Do Diary Web App

**Welcome!** Organize your tasks in style with this to-do list application. It's a Progressive Web App (PWA), allowing you to use it offline and install it on your device.

**Features:**

* **Add tasks:** Create new tasks with titles, dates, and times.
* **Edit tasks:** Modify existing tasks with updated details.
* **Delete tasks:** Remove tasks you don't need anymore.
* **Organization:** Keep track of your tasks in a clear and visually appealing list.
* **Responsive design:** Enjoy a seamless experience on both mobile and desktop devices.

* **PWA capabilities:** Use the app offline and install it on your device for easy access.

**Getting Started:**

1. **Prerequisites:** You'll need a web server to run the app locally. We recommend using http-server (`npm install -g http-server`).


**File Structure:**

* `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure of the application.
* `styles.css`: Defines the styling (consider mentioning a specific style if it's not generic).
* `script.js`: Handles JavaScript logic for managing tasks (adding, editing, deleting).
* `manifest.json`: Provides metadata for the PWA functionality.
* `service-worker.js`: Enables offline functionality by caching files.
* `icons/`: Folder containing icons used for the PWA (e.g., icon-192x192.png).

**Using the App:**

* **Adding a Task:**
    1. Enter the task title in the "New Task" input field.
    2. Select the due date and time for the task.
    3. Click "Add Task" to create the task.
* **Editing a Task:**
    1. Click the "Edit" button next to the task you want to modify.
    2. Update the task details in the input fields.
    3. Save your changes to reflect the edits.
* **Deleting a Task:**
    1. Click the "Delete" button next to the task you want to remove.
    2. Confirm the deletion to remove the task from the list.

**PWA Installation:**

When you visit the app in your browser, you should see an option to install it as a PWA. This allows you to access it offline and manage it like any other app on your device.

**Service Worker and Manifest:**

* **Service Worker (`service-worker.js`):** This script registers in the background to cache necessary files for offline use.
* **Manifest (`manifest.json`):** This file defines metadata about the app, enabling features like installation and notifications.

**Responsive Design:**

The app is designed to be responsive, ensuring a smooth user experience on various devices, from mobile phones to desktop screens.
